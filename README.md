UOJ Question bank is a quiz site which is designed to help the Faculty of science, University of Jaffna undergraduates to improvise their knowledge by doing online model questions. In this site students can do the sample mcq quiz and will be evaluated automatically by the system. In this quiz system there is an option to upload questions as well, so that the users are able to upload some questions by themselves too. Those uploaded questions will be checked by the lecturers and approved by them to display in the quiz. In simple words this system helps to share knowledge among people. Also there's another option to upload and download past papers, here people can upload or download the past papers. Our mission is to help the students of Faculty of science, University of Jaffna in their studies.
